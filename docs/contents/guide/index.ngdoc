> AngularJS opinionated ui components and utils

This repository bundles a few modules in the `ng.cork.ui` namespace.

If are only a few, consider depending on the individual packages instead.


## Bundled Modules:

- **[ng.cork.ui.enter-click](https://github.com/cork-labs/ng.cork.ui.enter-click)** - A directive that converts "Enter" keypress events into click events.
- **[ng.cork.ui.focus-on](https://github.com/cork-labs/ng.cork.ui.focus-on)** - A directive to set element focus on scope message or on render.
- **[ng.cork.ui.keys](https://github.com/cork-labs/ng.cork.ui.keys)** - A service to normalize key codes across browsers and match keys by tag
- **[ng.cork.ui.stop-propagation](https://github.com/cork-labs/ng.cork.ui.stop-propagation)** - A directive to stop propagation of selected events through the element.
- **[ng.cork.ui.textarea-auto-resize](https://github.com/cork-labs/ng.cork.ui.textarea-auto-resize)** - A directive to resize textareas on user input or programatic changes.


## Getting Started

Add **ng.cork.ui** to you project.

Via bower:

```
$ bower install --save ng.cork.ui
```

Via npm:

```
$ npm install --save ng.cork.ui
```


Include the following JS files in your build:
- `dist/ng.cork.ui.js` OR `dist/ng.cork.ui.min.js`


## Contributing

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make it even better than it is today!

Make sure you read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/cork-labs/ng.cork.ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.


## Developing

Clone this repository, install the dependencies and simply run `grunt develop`.

```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ grunt develop
```

At this point, the source was validated, tested and built into the `build/` directory. A simple webserver is launched so
that you can browse the generated code, documentation and the code coverage. If you now edit and save any project file,
the necessary `grunt` tasks will be triggered to update the build and docs.

```

More info on the (Grunt based) tools can be found in the
[boilerplate documentation](http://jarvis.cork-labs.org/boilerplate-nglib/current/docs).
